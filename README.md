# Customer-segmentation-using-K-means-clustering

In this projects we look at a 6 months of bank data of its customers. The goal is to divide the customer base into distinct groups based on certain characteristics or behaviors in order to better understand the diverse needs and preferences of different customer groups and tailor marketing strategies, product offerings, and services to effectively target each segment. This process is called marketing segmentation.
First we clean and prepare the data for analysis and find the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. Then, we apply K-means clustering method to perform the cluster analysis. Finally, we use principal component analysis to visualize the clusters.
